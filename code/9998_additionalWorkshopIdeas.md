## Other ideas for subsequent workshops:

-"Crafting spatial data": A lesson on combining field data with GPS points; st operations
-"Intermediate raster operations": A lesson on extracting data from rasters at particular GPS coordinates; combining multiple raster products, and visualizing multiple raster datasets in the same map
